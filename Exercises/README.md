# :pencil2: Exercises

The goal of these exercises is to create a Continuous Integration/Continuous
Testing/Continuous Deployment (CI/CT/CD) workflow using Docker-based GitHub
Actions.

The numbered exercises walk through creating a basic CI action and iteratively
build a complex, thorough workflow.
