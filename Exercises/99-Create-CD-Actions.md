# Create Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment Actions

Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) can reduce the challenge of
getting your finished code or product into the hands of your end users.
Automating processes such as building, testing, and deploying your code reduces
the risk of human error and enables faster delivery or deployment.

Two of the main factors to consider when designing a CI/CD workflow are _what
you are building_ and _how often you are building it_.

- If releases only happen every quarter, fully automating the release process
  may require more effort than it is worth. However, a solid, documented
  workflow will still help the process.
- If you are deploying more often, a consistent, automated workflow driven by
  developer events will help you deliver faster and with less risk.

The examples we have will help solve most of the use cases.
